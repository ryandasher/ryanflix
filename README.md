# Ryanflix

This is a small web application I built so I can randomly select an episode from my favorite tv shows. I built this because I wish Netflix had a random button where you just tell it which show you want to watch and it surprises you with a random episode. I've already watched every episode of Archer and Always Sunny, and sometimes I just want to put it on in the background while I do terrible programming.

# State of the API

The first iteration of this will be built with handcrafted JSON, because Netflix killed its public API in November, and the other APIs I've found won't allow me to retrieve the data I need. If you have any better suggestions, I'll gladly consider them.
