# Ryanflix

This is a small web application I built so I can randomly select an episode from my favorite tv shows. I built this because I wish Netflix/Amazon Instant had a random button where you just tell it which show you want to watch and it surprises you with a random episode. I've already watched every episode of Archer and Always Sunny, and sometimes I just want to put it on in the background while I do terrible programming.

### TODOs

* Come up with a more automated solution.
* Display an image so we have that graphical pop.
